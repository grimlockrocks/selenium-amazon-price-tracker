Use Selenium WebDriver to monitor Amazon product price

When you do not have an Amazon Associate account to access AWSECommerceService or developer id to access Walmart, Best Buy, or Target, you will not be able to crawl the product information from their website. However, using Selenium can automate web crawling programtically. To scale, you may use AWS Device Farm but it is not cheap - $0.17 per minute.
